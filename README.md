In this project, we are going to build a smart farming sysem using the Internet of Things
Technology. This project will help farmers to maintain their fields without excessive human involvement.
In this method, we will utilize the latest IoT technologies to build a real-time monitoring
system for the farmers. It will provide data such as teemperature, humidity and soil
moisture to the farmers so that the farmers can adjust their field conditions
accordingly.
